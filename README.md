# Candidate-Evaluation
My candidate evaluation of the two projects: Moving Averages and Widget Factory

# Quick Notes
I did not know much of markdown when I started
Every project will contain a file by the name of "readme.md" which contains information specific to the project
A folder by the name of "executables" will contain pre-compiled versions for your convince
